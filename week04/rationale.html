    <a href="http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/4-interface-design/2-navigation.html">Guideline</a>
    <br />
    <h3>Rationale</h3>
    <br />
    <span>
      It is now clear what page the user is currently on, as the active page 
      link is in a different color. Navigation is the same throughout all 
      pages, and the page title is clear.

    <span>
      Sites should appear simple due to the design of the layout.
      The layout has been adjusted to be pleasing to the eye on big screens
      as well as smaller screens.
