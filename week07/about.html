        <h3>About Ken</h3>
        <p>
          Originally started in 2006, Metalfor LLC was envisioned as a job shop for
          design work, fabrication, machining and welding.
          <br />
          After graduating the Robert Bosch Apprentice Program and receiving a
          degree in Machine Tool Technology, Kenith Chambers was employed as an
          instructor at Bosch. He then took an opportunity to do prototype and design work
          at Hill-Rom, a medical device company. With a talent for design, new product
          development came easy. After obtaining over 50 US and European Patents, he
          decided to open his own business in the areas of design of prototypes, machining,
          welding, repair work and 3-D signage.
          <br />
          He has come to know that if he can conceive and idea and believe it in his
          mind, he can achieve it.
